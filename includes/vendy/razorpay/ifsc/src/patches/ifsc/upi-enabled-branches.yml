# This file only contains "banks with custom sublets" who do not have
# their own IFSC code. This is quite rare, but happens ocassionally.
# In one specific case, MDCB0680265 support UPI, but the parent bank
# MDCB does not. So separating this way ensures that the UPI: true
# flag is only enabled for the relevant branches, and not the whole
# bank.
